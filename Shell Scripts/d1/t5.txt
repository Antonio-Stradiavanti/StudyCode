Several operations inspect a file’s type, 
meaning that they can determine whether something is a regular file,
a directory, or some kind of special device, as listed in Table 11-1. 
There are also a number of unary operations that check a file’s permissions, 
as listed in Table 11-2.
(See Section 2.17 for an overview of permissions.)
